                <strong>Quantum Computing</strong> is a cutting-edge field of computing that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in a fundamentally different way than classical computing. While classical computers rely
                on bits (0s and 1s) to store and manipulate data, quantum computers use quantum bits, known as qubits. Unlike classical bits, qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, a phenomenon called superposition.

                Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize various industries, including cryptography, drug discovery, optimization problems, and artificial intelligence. It could provide breakthroughs in solving complex problems that are currently computationally
                intractable for classical computers.

                Superposition is when the quantum system is present in more than one state at the same time. It’s an inherent ability of the quantum system. We can consider the time machine as an example to explain superposition. The person in the time machine is present
                in more than one place at the same time. Similarly, when a particle is present in multiple states at once, it is called superposition

                Entanglement is the correlation between the quantum particles. The particles are connected in a way that even if they were present at the opposite ends of the world, they’ll still be in sync and ‘dance’ simultaneously. The distance between the particles
                doesn’t matter as the entanglement between them is very strong. Einstein had described this phenomenon as ‘spooky action at a distance’

                A quantum bit is a measure of data storage unit in quantum computers. The quantum bit is a subatomic particle that can be made of electrons or photons. Every quantum bit or Qbit adheres to the principles of superposition and entanglement. This makes things
                hard for scientists to generate Qbits and manage them. That’s because Qbits can show multiple combinations of zeros and ones (0 & 1) at the same time (superposition)

                Scientists use laser beams or microwaves to manipulate Qbits. Though the final result collapses to the quantum state of 0 or 1, the concept of entanglement is in force. When the two bits of the pair are placed at a distance, they are still connected to
                each other. A change in the state of one Qbit will automatically result in the change of state for the related Qbit. Such connected groups of Qbits are powerful compared to single binary digits used in classical computing

                Quantum data is the data that occurs in the natural or artificial quantum system or is generated by a quantum computer (data from Sycamore processor for Google’s demonstration is one example). Quantum data shows signs of superposition and entanglement.
                This leads to joint probability distributions, which require a huge amount of classical computing power for processing and storing.

                Though a quantum model can generalize and represent data with a quantum mechanical origin, it still cannot generalize quantum data using a quantum processor alone. This is because the near-quantum processors are noisy and limited. NISQ processors should
                work in tandem with quantum processors to make it an efficient model
